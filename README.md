# A custom graph tool plugin for Unreal Engine 5

This is a custom graph tool plugin for Unreal Engine 5 that I created. With this tool you can create custom nodes, establish connections between them, and get the structured data with helper functions. 

## Motivation

I made this tool in order to learn more about creating custom tools in Unreal Engine. This project is motivated by the perceived shortcomings in the documentation currently available for building custom tools in the Unreal Editor. My goal in creating this customized Graph Tool is to give those who want to create their own customized solutions in the Unreal Engine environment a useful tool that can also be used as a learning resource.
